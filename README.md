# Predictability-First-Analysis-of-Time-Series-Forecasting
_A priority-aware framework for layer-wise material selection (Metal–Dielectric–Semiconductor) with single-pass 3D evaluation._

This repository provides the full implementation of Predictability-First Analysis of Time-Series Forecasting for Semiconductor Equipment Health Monitoring, including:
- DATA ANALYSIS OF PREDICTABILITY
- Machine Learning/Sattatical/Deep Learning models for Time-Series Forecasting
- Equipment degradation timeseries forecasting dataset
